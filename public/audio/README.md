# Call Recording Audio Files

## Instructions

Place your MP3 audio file in this directory with the name: **`customer-agent-conversation.mp3`**

### Audio Content Should Include:

A realistic customer service conversation covering common support issues:

1. **Curriculum Link Not Received**
   - Customer complains about not receiving the curriculum link
   - Agent apologizes and resends the link

2. **Dashboard Not Opening**
   - Customer reports dashboard showing blank screen
   - Agent troubleshoots (asks about cache clearing)
   - Agent creates technical support ticket

3. **Course Content Unclear / Videos Too Fast**
   - Customer complains videos are playing too fast
   - Agent provides solution (playback speed settings)

### Sample Script for Recording:

**Agent:** Good morning! This is Sarah from customer support. How may I assist you today?

**Customer:** Hi Sarah, I'm having multiple issues. First, I haven't received the curriculum link that was supposed to be sent yesterday.

**Agent:** I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me check your account. Can you please provide your registered email address?

**Customer:** It's john.doe@email.com. Also, my dashboard is not opening properly - it just shows a blank screen.

**Agent:** I see your account now. Let me address both issues. First, I'll resend the curriculum link immediately. For the dashboard issue, have you tried clearing your browser cache?

**Customer:** Yes, I've tried that already. It's still not working. And one more thing - the course content is not very clear. The videos are too fast.

**Agent:** I understand. For the dashboard, I'll create a technical support ticket for our IT team. They'll contact you within 2 hours. The curriculum link has been sent to your email now.

**Customer:** Okay, that's good. But what about the video speed issue?

**Agent:** You can adjust the playback speed in the video player settings. Click the gear icon and select your preferred speed - 0.75x or 0.5x for slower playback.

**Customer:** Oh, I didn't know that! Let me check my email for the curriculum link... Yes, I got it now. Thank you!

**Agent:** Great! Your ticket number is T00234 for the dashboard issue. Our tech team will reach out soon. Is there anything else I can help you with?

**Customer:** No, that covers everything. Thanks for your help, Sarah!

**Agent:** You're welcome! Have a wonderful day and happy learning!
